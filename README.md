## Description

BreezyGen is a mod for the game "Terraria" which aims to modify the World
Generation in an effort to make the game less grindy. The intended audience
for this mod is Casual Players who are looking for a short-term Terraria
experience. This is performed by detouring various passes of the World Generation
process to double item and tile generation where applicable.

## Current Features

At the moment, the only feature that BreezyGen offers is doubling the Strength
and Steps used to generate Copper and Iron.

## Planned Features

In order of the sequences that I'd like to implement them in, I hope to implement
the following features into BreezyGen:

- Doubling the Strength and Steps of all Pre-Hardmode ores to achieve the generation
of larger veins.

- Buffing the loot that is obtainable within most, if not all Chests.

- An Overhaul of the Boss System, with reductions in HP and Attacking Power in all
bosses.

New features will be added to this list as I come up with them. I am also open to
suggestions!
